1)COVID-19:- As asked in viva  i ran the code using latest data files it ran succesfully for 1st and 2nd questions but as there is hard coding for 3rd question i got trouble later i removed the hard coding and made some changes in code such that it can now use any excel file to analyse data but file should contain data in specific format as there in uploaded files.
